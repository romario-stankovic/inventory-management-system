<h1 align="center">Inventory Management System</h1>

"Inventory Management System" is a final exam project from the "Object Oriented Programming 1" course at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students about OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, interfacing, inheritance, design patterns, etc. using the Java programming language.

The topic for this project was free, but there were some minimal requirements that had to be fulfilled. The application had to contain at least 4 classes, from which one should be an abstract class and at least one should implement an interface. There was also the need for file I/O operations for saving/loading data from/into the application.

The topic chosen for this project was an "Inventory management system" which contains a couple of different user types, items and categories over which these users manipulate.
